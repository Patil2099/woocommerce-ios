We heard that orders containing multiple configurations of the same variable product can be confusing to fulfill with the app. This update fixes that and makes those items appear separately, making it easier to read. In that same spirit, orders with multiple shipments from the WooCommerce Shipping & Tax extension will show as separate sections.

If the app has trouble loading data, we now show a helpful message with instructions on how to reach out for help. Most times, itâ€™s a plugin causing issues, but we can help walk you through resolving it!
