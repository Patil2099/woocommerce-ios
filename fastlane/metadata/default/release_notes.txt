We’re excited to announce updates to the WooCommerce iOS app.

It’s now easier than ever to edit the attributes of variable products — for instance, the color and size of clothing.
We fixed bugs affecting the “Back” button and the display of product thumbnails.
Plus, for items that fit the description, product type details now include “Downloadable.”
