Due to popular demand, we’ve brought back the order fulfillment screen when tapping on Mark Order Complete. Thank you to everyone who reached out to let us know your interest in that functionality!

We’ve added initial support for creating shipping labels to the app! Want to give it a try? Install and activate the WooCommerce Shipping & Tax extension in your store. Right now, we support merchants in the USA shipping to USA addresses. We welcome your feedback!
