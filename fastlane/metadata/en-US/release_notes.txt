Product variations only support one image, so if a product variation already has an image, youâ€™ll see an option to replace or remove it but will not be able to add another one.

We received reports of crashes when selecting images from the Media Library, which occurred with libraries that had a specific number of images. This issue has been fixed.

We also improved an error message that displayed when a customer logged into a site with an offline device, an invalid SSL certificate, or a blocked XML-RPC. The updated messaging makes it easier for people to troubleshoot their login issue.
